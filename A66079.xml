            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Tender Bowels of love, do I feel (from the Lord) a warning Spring in my heart to you, that you all may be kept low in his humble ſelf denying Life, where ſafety is to be found. For aſſuredly, the great and Notable day of the Lord is at hand, in which he will ariſe in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength, to plead the cauſe of his ſuffering Seed, with all its enemies, whether within, or without.</p>
            <p>So all Dear Friends be faithful under your ſeveral diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, For in our Fathers houſe are many Manſions, Keep in the low valleys; For there will be your ſafety, there will the green paſtures of Gods love be partaken of, and with ſuch will he delight to dwell. So all Friends keep to your watch, that the day of the Lord come not in an hour you look not for it, and ſo you receive the unfaithful Servants Reward, for indeed Friends my ſoul is in a great Travel for the Proſperity of Sion, that her walls may be builded, her breaches Repaired and made up.

               <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->yea ſome years, hath my ſpirit been bowed down and groaned under the ſenſe of an eaſeful, ſelfiſh, Lukewarm Spirit, that hath crept in upon many for want of watchfulneſſe, and Keeping to the Dayly Croſs of Chriſt Jeſus, and in the Narrow way, and Savoury life, that only will bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe to the Name of the Lord. And how to be eaſed of theſe weights and burdens I did not know, my cry was to the Lord that he would give me wiſdome, and ſtrength to do his will. And it pleaſed him to lay his hand upon me and bring me near to the gates of Death (ſo far as I ſaw) and was pleaſed to hide himſelfe from me, and my Soul was in a languiſhing condition, and my cryes was great unto the Lord that he would not hide his face from me, but let me feel of his wonted goodneſs, and mercy, by which I had received daily comfort and ſatisfaction from him in his unerring path, in which he had been pleaſed to lead me. And at length the Lord appeared, and ſaid he would be my Phiſition and cure my diſeaſe, and came in and comforted my Spirit, with his overcoming love, which greatly revived me. And in the openings of the bowels of his endleſſe love, he ſhewed me, a Terrible day drew near, (even as one may ſay at the doors.) And laid it upon me, to goe warn his people in this City (and elſewhere) to Depart from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe both of fleſh and Spirit, from all Lukewarmneſs, from the faſhions, cuſtomes, and friendſhips of this world, from Pride, Covetouſneſs and every ſin that ſeperatech from the Lord, and brings dryneſſe, barronneſſe, and deadneſſe, upon many, and made as unſavoury ſalt, that was good for nothing, but to be caſt forth and trodden upon.</p>
            <p>And to warn them not to delay time, but come into the true humility, lowlineſſe of ſpirit, and felfedenying life, that the Lord might be a hiding place to them, for terrible will that day be to all the unfaithful and diſobedient. All the ſinners in Sion ſhall be afraid, fearfulneſſe ſhall take hold on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97367:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->the Hypocrite. Dread and horror ſhall ſurpriſe them. O whither will you unfaithful fly! would you not be glad that either Rocks or Mountains could hide you from the preſence of the Lord, and the wrath of the Lamb. O this will be a terrible day indeed, unto all thoſe that have had a form of Godlineſſe, but denyed the power, that would have ſaved them out of all defilements and pollutions of this world.</p>
            <p>For long hath the Spirit of the Lord been grieved with theſe, who have long come and ſitten amongſt Gods people, as if they had been of them, but never came to ſink down to the heart ſearching Light of Chriſt Jeſus in them, that by it they might be cleanſed, from all ſecret and open ſins, from every Dalilah that lodgeth in the boſome, as Pride and Coveteouſneſſe, which often the one attends the other, Covetouſneſſe (ſaith the ſervant of the Lord,) is the root of all evil, and adviſed them to fly from it, but who abide not in the ſpirit of judgement, and of Burning, which God hath prepared to purge away the filth of the daughter of Sion, their filth hath not been purged nor done away, which cauſeth many miſcarriages, blots and ſtaines, and great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections have ſuch brought upon the bleſſed truth; and much dirt hath been thrown upon the pure holy undefiled way of the Lord, which he hath caſt up, for the Ranſomed to walk in, and ſo through the unfaithfulneſs and uneven walking of ſuch, the name of the Lord hath been greatly diſhonoured, his Spirit grieved, and the hearts of the Righteous made ſad. And many a wounded Soul there is amongſt the Lords people, who are bowed under theſe weights and preſſures, but aſſuredly the day haſtens that every one muſt bear their own burden, and the Lord will caſe his Innocent ones, who have been bowed down before him, and have mourned and groaned under theſe things: yea, the day haſtens, that the unfaithful and diſobedient ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97367:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->bear their own burdens. And the Lord will ariſe for his own Name and Glory ſake, and will caſe him of his enemies, and avenge him of his adverſaries, and take to himſelfe his great power, that he may Reign and Rule in the hearts of his, that (faithfully labour in his work, and) ordereth their converſations aright before him; his glory ſhall reſt upon them, for he will not give it to another ſeed, or birth, but to Chriſt Jeſus the ſeed of the woman; who was given to bruiſe the Serpents head; he hath born the iniquities of all, and been preſſed under them as a Cart with ſheaves, his face hath been more marred then any mans, and his voice not heard in the ſtreets, no beauty nor comlineſſe ſeen in him. And becauſe he hath been a man of ſorrowes, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with griefs, therefore hath he been paſſed by and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, but the Lord will make him the joy of many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; and his Sion the praiſe of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Therefore Dear Friends, love him with all your Souls, and be you delighted in him, above all injoyments whatever, that you may lye down in the boſome of his love, and be nouriſhed by his ſide, as Children of our heavenly-Father; begotten by the Immoral word of life, to Live and Reign hear with him (in it,) and when time ſhall be no more, enter into that bleſſed reſt, prepared for all them that have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his glorious Goſpel: and though as yet we be but as the gleaning of the Vintage, yet the Lord hath many to gather year, the numberleſs number ſhall be gathered. And great will be the work of our God, which he is bringing to paſs in this his bleſſed day, it cannot be declared, as it is ſeen and felt in the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>So Friends be faithful in the work of your day, be valliant for the Lord and his bleſſed truth: Come up in the Nobillity of his life, and ſtand faithful witneſſes for him; for we are the City ſet upon a hill, yea, battle Axes in Gods hand, Though our weapons are not carnal, but Spiritual, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97367:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->mighty through the power of God, to the pulling down the ſtrong holds of ſin and Sathan: Friends, we are they whom the Lord hath raiſed to hold forth Chriſt Jeſus, whom he hath given for an enſign to the Nations, unto whom all the ends of the earth muſt come for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</p>
            <p>So Dear Friends, let your light ſhine forth before men that they may ſee your good workes and gloryfie your heavenly father, ſo that by your godly life and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation many may enquire the way to Sion.</p>
            <p>All Friends be faithful, and keep your meetings, in the fear of the Lord, be dilligent in his work, for the woe and Curſe belongs to them that do the Lords work negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently (or with careleſs minds,) and it is come on ſome all-ready, and will come more upon others, if by ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they return not unto the Lord. So be Zealous for the Lord and his truth, and as much as in you lies gather orderly together as neare the time as poſſible; that the meeting is appointed at, for Diſorderly comeing hath been a hurt and burdened the faithfull who dare not be negligent, in the Lords work; and often they have waited a Conſiderable ſeaſon and Gods power hath been felt, and the manifold grace of God been diſpenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and then others comes in: and miſſes of the Counſels, Admonitions, and Refreſhments which the Lord by the operation of his bleſſed ſpirit hands forth to his people, and ſo for want of Zeal in comeing duly to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (eſpecially on the week dayes) truth hath not grown in them, but ſuch have long travelled in the wilderneſs: and many Carkaſſes fall'n there, and ſo for want of Zeal and faithfulneſs the enemy hath crept in, and darkned many minds, where once there was tender good deſires raiſed after God, So all have need to be faithful and wait
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97367:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->dilligently every oppertunity the Lord gives you to feel your ſtrengths renewed, for in the world is many Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances and Intanglements, ſome on one hand, and ſome on another to draw the mind from God, (and but one to draw it to him,) ſo there is great need of holy zeal and dilligence, in obſerving the time to wait upon the Lord to feel your ſtrength renewed; to help through the many things and his power to ſtrengthen and ſupport, that in your families and all your undertakings you may be a good ſavour to the Lord, being guided by his wiſdome to rule and order your Children and Servants, and he will give Authority to ſtand over every thing thats contrary to his witneſs, And in the feare of the Lord I warn and Exhort all parents not to winke or Connive at any ſin in your Children, as you tender their Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting welbeing, let no ſin go on reproved or corrected, but take the wiſe mans counſel who ſaith; Folly is bound up in the heart of a Child but the rod of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection muſt drive it out, And he that corrects his Child ſhall deliver his Soul from Death: So friends Traine up your Children in the Bleſſed truth and fear of the Lord, So may you have hope they will not depart from it (when they are old.) And take heed of giving way or ſuffering them to get into pride, and the vain and fooliſh faſhions, which are a ſhame to Sober people, and a great inlet to many evils, for they are prone to that by nature, and it may ſoon be ſet up, but hard to get it down; So Friends keep the yoak upon that Nature thats Proud, Stubborn, or Diſobedient to Parents, break that will in them betimes which comes from the evil one, and bend them while they are young, leaſt when they grow up yon cannot. And then you may ſorrow greatly when it is too late, for by your over looking their Folly, or Pride, the wrong Nature
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97367:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->growes in them to a ſtrong head, whereby you have help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them forwards in the broad way which leads to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and their blood (may come) to be required at your hands. Ah Friends, friends, as much as in you lies keep down the evil, and the good will ariſe, then their will be Room for the tender ſeed to grow up in them, and they will bleſs the Lord on your behalfs, for your love and care of their Immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>And all Maſters and Miſtriſſes of Families, Keep in the Dominion of Truth, that in it you may Rule over every unclean thing, and wrong Spirit, that is contrary to the Lord, that you abiding in him who is the higheſt power, (and higher then the powers of darkeneſſe) may in it keep in your Authority in your Families, and look that all be kept ſweet and clean, out of the Condemnable ſtate, firſt in your ſelves; and then in your families to ſee that all Wildneſs, Wantonneſs, and Rudeneſs, be kept under by the power; yea every thing that would blot or ſtaine the precious truth. And then if the Lord Require any Service or Teſtimony of any of you, (for this name and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed truth,) that all may be cleare in your ſelves and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Gods witneſs, that you have ſtood in his Counſel and Authority in your families and been good Examples in life and converſation, by keeping your own houſes in the good Order, and Ruleing their for God, then may you openly with boldneſs appear for the Lord, and threſh down ſin and every evil way, in the power and Authority of his life, that none may have any thing to accuſe any of you, (on the accounts above mentioned,) And deare Friends all keep in the ſavory life; but more eſpecially you who are drawn forth to beare publick Teſtimonys for the Lord and his bleſſed truth, keep you to the watch that at all times, Places, and on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

            <p>Now unto all you young people Sons and Daughters, Apprentices, Men or Maids, Servants, all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Gods truth and the way that leads to everlaſting life and happineſs, be you all faithful to Gods witneſs in you, and mind the motions and opperations of it, that thereby you may be changed, and all judge out whats contrary to his pure witneſs, let not your minds wander neither look out at the vanities in this world, for Chriſts Kingdome is not of it, nor to be found in Pride, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and luſts of the fleſh; The Faſhions, Cuſtomes, and friendſhips of this world, for the Devil is the King of pride, and all its attendants that leads to the gates of Hell and everlaſting deſtruction, where is the Woe and Miſery and that for evermore, there the worm never dyes, the fire never goes out, ſo all you young and tender ones, where deſires are begotten after God, keep you low in his fear, and to the daily Croſs that all the contrary may be crucified, and all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie ſlain upon it. For every one that will be a diſciple of Chriſt Jeſus, muſt come into the ſelfedenying life, (you cannot have two Kingdomes,) So my advice to you all is, ſtoop to Chriſts appearance in you, he who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites all to come and learn of him, who is meek and lowly and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls. So all be faithful in your ſeveral places and the exerciſes you may be under, that you may grow in grace and in the feare and wiſdome of God, let not your eys look out at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but mind your own Conditions for if you do it
